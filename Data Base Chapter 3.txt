Data Base Chapter 3
-------------------

3.1
A database can be created from:
- Existing data
- Redesigning an existing system
- Developing a new information system

3.2
Understanding the relational model and normalization helps us design efficient databases and fix data integrity problems.

3.3
A multivalued dependency occurs when one attribute is linked to multiple values.

3.4
Key database terms:
1. Relation: A table with rows and columns, where each row represents a single entity.
2. Functional dependency: When one attribute determines the value of another attribute.
3. Determinant: The attribute that determines the value of another attribute.
4. Candidate key: A unique identifier for each record in a table.
5. Composite key: A key made up of two or more columns.
6. Primary key: A unique identifier for each record in a table.
7. Surrogate key: A generated key used as a primary key when no natural key exists.
8. Foreign key: A primary key in one table that appears in another table to establish a relationship.
9. Referential integrity constraint: Ensures that foreign key values match existing primary key values.
10. Normal form: A measure of a table's design quality based on data integrity problems.

3.5
A relational table has the following characteristics:
1. All values in a column are of the same type.
2. Each row represents a single entity.
3. Each cell contains a single value.
4. Each column has a unique name.
5. No two rows are identical.

3.6
A table is not relational if it has:
1. Multiple values in a single cell.
2. Rows with a specific order.

3.7
To reference a field in a table, we use the table name, dot operator, and field name.

3.10
A functional dependency can arise from a mathematical calculation or a real-world rule.

3.11
If knowing one attribute (part number) determines another attribute (part weight), then part number functionally determines part weight.

3.13
When two or more attributes (first name, last name) determine another attribute (phone number), it's a functional dependency.

3.14
When two or more attributes determine another attribute, it's a functional dependency.

3.17
In a database, "Buyer" determines the items purchased and the department, but "Department" only determines the list of buyers.

3.20-3.26
A candidate key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. A primary key is a special candidate key that uniquely identifies each record. A surrogate key is a generated key used as a primary key when no natural key exists.

3.29
A foreign key is a column or set of columns that references a primary key in another table. Its significance is to ensure data consistency.

3.31
Normal form refers to the design quality of a table based on data integrity problems.

3.33
A table with data integrity problems is susceptible to update anomalies.

3.34
A relational table must have:
1. Unique rows.
2. Columns with unique names.
3. Rows with the same number of columns.

3.36
To achieve 2NF, a table must be in 1NF, and all non-key attributes must depend on the key attributes.

3.37
To achieve 3NF, a table must be in 2NF, and no non-key attribute can depend on another non-key attribute.

3.38
To achieve a higher normal form, every determinant must be a candidate key.
